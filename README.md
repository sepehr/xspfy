# XSPFy

Migrates XSPF playlists to Spotify where they can grow old.

It's the ancestor of [Laspotipy](https://github.com/sepehr/laspotipy). Laspotipy does not work anymore as Last.fm's Playlist API does not work anymore. Exported XSPF playlists can be imported using this utility instead.

As of the new fuckin lastfm beta, playlists can be found on the old website:  
https://www.last.fm/user/lajevardi/library/playlists  

The built-in export feature does not work anymore as the Playlists API is gone. Consider using a workaround to scrape and save data locally:
